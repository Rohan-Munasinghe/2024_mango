29-Dec-2023<br /><br />Dear Prof. Munasinghe:<br /><br />Manuscript ID TAFE=
-10-0063-2023.R1 entitled "RFID Based Fruit Monitoring and Orchard Manageme=
nt System" which you submitted to the IEEE Transactions on AgriFood Electro=
nics, has been reviewed. =C2=A0The comments of the reviewer(s) are included=
 at the bottom of this letter.<br /><br />The reviewer(s) have recommended =
publication, but also suggest some revisions to your manuscript. =C2=A0Ther=
efore, I invite you to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments and revise your=
 manuscript.<br /><br />To revise your manuscript, log into https://ieee.at=
yponrex.com/journal/TAFE and enter your Author Dashboard where you will fin=
d your manuscript with a "Revise Submission" link.<br /><br /><br />You wil=
l be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of t=
he manuscript. =C2=A0Instead, revise your manuscript using a word processin=
g program and save it on your computer. =C2=A0Please also highlight the cha=
nges to your manuscript within the document by using the track changes mode=
 in MS Word or by using bold or colored text.<br /><br />Once the revised m=
anuscript is prepared, you can upload it and submit it through your Author =
Center.<br /><br />When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be abl=
e to respond to the comments made by the reviewer(s) in the space provided.=
 =C2=A0You can use this space to document any changes you make to the origi=
nal manuscript. =C2=A0In order to expedite the processing of the revised ma=
nuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the reviewe=
r(s).<br /><br />Because we are trying to facilitate timely publication of =
manuscripts submitted to the IEEE Transactions on AgriFood Electronics, you=
r revised manuscript should be submitted by 27-Feb-2024. =C2=A0If it is not=
 possible for you to submit your revision by this date, we may have to cons=
ider your paper as a new submission.<br /><br />Once again, thank you for s=
ubmitting your manuscript to the IEEE Transactions on AgriFood Electronics =
and I look forward to receiving your revision.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />P=

:<br />dear authors,<br /><br />based on the reviewers comments enclosed, w=

 revised version of the paper =E2=80=9CRFID Based Fruit Monitoring and Orch=
ard Management System=E2=80=9D addresses all the comments I made in the fir=
st revision, and it=E2=80=99s considerably improved compared to the origina=
l draft.<br />I think the paper is now acceptable for publication, even tho=
ugh some of the amendments are minimal, e.g. the pilot with only 20 mangos,=
 which is hardly statistically significant.<br /><br />Reviewer 2<br />The =
article has been improved compared to the previous version. However, the da=
ta provided as a result of the small-scale pilot project implementation is =
insufficient. At moment this article is not suitable for publishing as it i=
s, due to lake of proper device characterization plots (regarding the devic=
e all the given numbers are based on assumption/approximation) and not havi=
ng enough data regarding field tests, below are my suggestions for the auth=
or:<br /><br />- I would recommend to rewrite the description of the sectio=
n "Fallen and Missing Fruits". This section could be improved by providing =
direct explanation of the mechanism for the detection of missing and fallen=
 fruits. Additionally, a table could be added to show the number of detecte=
d missing and fallen fruits during each spraying/scan. This would help read=
ers better understand the process and results of the study.<br /><br />-The=
 field test data of a few mangos are not enough. The absence of time stamps=
 for each spraying and scan makes it difficult to understand the gap betwee=
n each spray. For the sake of larger data set, It would be better to increa=
se the number of trees and periodic scanning.<br /><br /><br />Reviewer Det=
ailed Comments:<br /><br /><br />1) Summarize the main thesis of the paper =
in 2-3 sentences:<br /><br /><br />2) Is there an identification of a conce=
ptual framework, theoretical framework or other used to inspire/lead the st=
udy?<br /><br /><br />3) Does the paper refer to seminal works? Are there a=
ny missing?<br /><br /><br />4) Is there a clear methodology statement?<br =
/><br /><br />5) Are there clear results (qualitative or quantitative) or o=
ther?<br /><br /><br />6) Is there technical rigour in the domain of Social=
 Implications of Technology?<br /><br /><br />7) Is this paper an original =
contribution to knowledge?<br /><br /><br />8) Was ethics approval gained? =
If so, have the details been provided?<br /><br /><br />9) Is the paper wri=
